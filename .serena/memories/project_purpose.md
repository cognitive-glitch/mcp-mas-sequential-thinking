# Project Purpose

The **Reflective Sequential Thinking MCP Server** is an advanced Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that implements reflective sequential thinking through a dual-team multi-agent system.

## Core Functionality
- Enables AI models to engage in sophisticated, structured thinking with self-reflection
- Provides intelligent tool selection capabilities with confidence scoring
- Supports non-linear thinking with branching and revision capabilities
- Implements fault tolerance through circuit breaker patterns

## Key Features
- **Dual-Team Architecture**: Primary thinking team + reflection team for meta-analysis
- **Async-Native Design**: Custom team coordination without asyncio.run() conflicts
- **Intelligent Tool Selection**: Built-in tool recommendation engine with confidence scoring
- **Reflective Reasoning**: Meta-analysis of thinking processes with quality assessment
- **Branching & Revision Support**: Non-linear thinking with thought revision capabilities
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Fault tolerance with graceful degradation
- **In-Memory Context**: Lightweight shared context (no persistence by design)

## Target Users
- AI researchers and developers
- Applications requiring sophisticated AI reasoning
- Systems that need structured thinking with quality assessment
- Tools requiring intelligent agent coordination
